# Father-s-day-project
INTRODUCTION
The image is a Father's Day advertisement for Design Verse, a design service provider. It features a heartwarming scene of a father and child.

INSPIRATION
The design is inspired by the need to promote Design Verse and its services while celebrating Father's Day. The use of a tender moment between a father and child is intended to evoke emotions and create a positive association with the brand.

 REASON FOR COLORS
The colors used in the image, including shades of brown, white, and red, were chosen for their warm and celebratory tone. The bold text "HAPPY FATHER'S DAY" is likely intended to draw attention to the occasion, while the red hearts add a touch of love and appreciation.
